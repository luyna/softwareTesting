Jmeter如何工作：
Jmeter模拟一系列用户给目标服务器发送请求，然后通过图形化的方式返回目标服务器响应结果。


Thread Group
Thread Groups is a collection of Threads. 
Each thread represents one user using the application under test. Basically, each Thread simulates one real user request to the server.

Samplers
As we know already that JMeter supports testing HTTP, FTP, JDBC and many other protocols.
We already know that Thread Groups simulate user request to the server
But how does a Thread Group know which type of requests (HTTP, FTP etc.) it needs to make?
The answer is Samplers

Listeners
Listeners: shows the results of the test execution. They can show results in a different format such as a tree, table, graph or log file
Graph result listeners display the server response times on a Graph
